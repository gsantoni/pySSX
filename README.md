# pySSX

This project aims at providing resources for the EOSC future science project on serial crystallography.

## Getting started


# Editing this README

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.


## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
USage of the class will happen through notebooks, located in the notebook folder.
More to come soon.

## Support
Still under early development.
## Roadmap
First release to be done before the end of 2022
